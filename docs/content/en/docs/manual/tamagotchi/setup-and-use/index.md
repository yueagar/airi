::: warning Before You Start
- Some technical functions and operations of AIRI will not be explained in detail in this manual.
- The primary editor is only responsible for the Chinese version of this manual. Other language versions are AI-translated and then lightly manually corrected, so they may not match the actual software. Please refer to the actual content.
- Please note that the images included in this manual have been added by non-Mujiu Yunxuan Studio members. Due to technical reasons, these images will not be updated promptly. We appreciate your understanding.
- Most of the content in this manual has been explored and researched by the editor-in-chief’s team members themselves, as well as other participants. It may not be consistent with the facts or may contain deviations. Please rely on your own actual experience as the final reference.
- This manual may not be updated in a timely manner.
- Due to limitations of capability and time, this manual currently only includes some detailed tutorials for AIRI installed via the installation package on the Windows platform.
- Some parts of the software use English without translation. This manual attempts to translate those parts, but the final interpretation should follow the actual software.
- Version updates may change content. This manual only describes the latest version before the writing time. If you encounter differences with other versions, please handle them yourself.
- If you have additions or questions about this manual, please @jhicefair on the official Project AIRI Discord channel and leave a message.

## Chapter 1 – Installation

Go to the Project AIRI GitHub homepage: [moeru-ai/airi](https://github.com/moeru-ai/airi)

Follow these steps:

1. Find the "**Releases**" option on the right side of the page.
2. Click "+ 68 releases".
3. Pick a version, find "**Assets**" below it, and expand.
4. Choose the version suitable for your computer and download it.
5. Locate the downloaded installer and double-click to install.

::: tip Download Page Notes
- The number in "+ 68 releases" only shows how many other releases exist, so yours may differ.
- You may also need to click "Show all 19 assets" at the bottom; that number may also vary.
- The following sections use the Windows installer version as an example.
- Due to time constraints, the installation walkthrough itself is skipped — you can handle it.

## Chapter 2 – Initial Configuration

<a id="chapter-2-prerequisites"></a>
### Section 1 – Preparation

Before you begin, you need to prepare at least one API from an LLM service provider.

::: info Terminology
* LLM

LLM stands for Large Language Model.
Simply put, an AI.

* API

API stands for Application Programming Interface.
It is a set of predefined rules that allow different software applications to communicate, exchange data, and share functions.
You don't need to understand it deeply, just know how to obtain one.
:::

::: tip Getting An API
There are many LLM providers, and the method for obtaining an API varies. Due to time constraints, no tutorial or example is provided here. Please search online or ask an AI.
:::

::: warning Keep Your API Key Safe
Once you have your API, keep it safe and do not share it with others.
:::

<a id="chapter-2-launch"></a>
### Section 2 – Launch Airi!

::: info Example
The steps below use Deepseek as the example provider.
:::

::: tip Regarding a possible bug during the initial startup and the solution
The first time you start the application, you may encounter this bug: the main interface border flickers, and when you click to expand the pop-up menu, it quickly retracts…

If you encounter this bug, don't worry—you can resolve it by following the steps below (but you'll need to be quick with your clicks):

First, click to expand at the exact moment when the flickering border goes dark.

Then quickly find the first option in the second row, 'Refresh', and click it. This will solve the problem.

This bug has not been fixed in recent versions. We will continue to report this issue to the development team and believe it will be resolved soon!
:::

Follow these steps to finish the first-time setup:

1. Open Airi (normally it opens automatically after installation).
2. Select your language in the main window.
3. Click "**setup with your provider**", alternatively, click on "**Login**" (Due to time constraints, the process for choosing to log in is not explained here. We appreciate your understanding!).
4. Select your service source and click "**Next**".
5. Enter your API Key and click "**Next**".
6. Click "**Next**" again.
7. Select the model you wish to use, then click "**Save and continue**".

Congratulations! You have completed the initial configuration of Airi.

## Chapter 3 – Airi Interface Overview

<a id="chapter-3-main-window"></a>
### Main Window

This window displays the virtual character. There are three buttons:

- "websocket status" – top right, click to open connection settings where you can configure your WebSocket server address (This option has been removed in the current version.).
- "Expand" – bottom right, click to reveal more options (see below).
- "Open hearing control" – bottom right, allows you to speak to Airi. Requires an STT service.
- "Move" – bottom right, long-press and drag to reposition the main window.

![Airi main window overview](./assets/manual-main-window.avif)

::: info About Hearing Control
It seems you also need to open the chat window first. Since this feature has not worked for the editor yet, the tutorial is omitted.
:::

::: info Terminology
* websocket

WebSocket is a network communication protocol that provides full-duplex, persistent connections between a browser and a server.
In simple terms, traditional HTTP is a "request-response" model (client requests, server responds, then disconnects), while WebSocket allows both parties to send messages at any time after the connection is established, without repeated requests.

* STT

STT stands for Speech-to-Text, also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR).
Its goal is to enable computers to understand human speech and convert it into text.
:::

Click "Expand" to reveal nine options:

- "Login" – You can log in to your own Airi account.
- "Open settings" – opens the settings window.
- "Switch character" – switch character cards.
- "Open chat" – opens the chat window.
- "Refresh" – refreshes the main window.
- "Switch to dark mode" – toggles light/dark theme.
- "Unpin" – makes the main window not always on top.
- "Always show" / "Hide on hover" – allows clicking through the window.
- "Close" – closes Airi.

![Airi expanded controls menu](./assets/manual-controls-island-expanded.avif)

<a id="chapter-3-system-tray"></a>
### System Tray Other Options

First, locate the Airi icon in the system tray.

::: tip Windows Taskbar Tip
On Windows, you may need to click "Show hidden icons" in the taskbar to find the Airi icon.
:::

Right-click the Airi icon to see ten options:

- "Show" – brings up the main window, usually not needed.
- "Adjust size" – adjusts the main window size and centers it. Includes four sub-options:
  - "Recommended (450x600)" – sets the window to the recommended 450x600 size.
  - "Full height" – makes the window's height span the full desktop height.
  - "Half height" – makes the window's height span half the desktop height.
  - "Full screen" – makes the window fill the entire desktop.
- "Align to" – aligns the main window to a specific screen position. Includes five sub-options:
  - "Center" – aligns to the center of the desktop.
  - "Top left" – aligns to the top-left corner.
  - "Top right" – aligns to the top-right corner.
  - "Bottom left" – aligns to the bottom-left corner.
  - "Bottom right" – aligns to the bottom-right corner.
- "Settings" – opens the settings window.
- "About" – details omitted.
- "Open quick actions" – details omitted.
- "Open widgets" – details omitted.
- "Open caption" – opens subtitles. Requires TTS service to display text when Airi speaks; hidden on hover by default.
- "Caption overlay" – includes two sub-options:
  - "Follow window" – default; caption position follows the main window.
  - "Reset position" – resets the caption position.
- "Quit" – closes Airi.

::: info Terminology
* TTS

TTS stands for Text-to-Speech, which converts written text into natural-sounding spoken output.
:::

<a id="chapter-3-settings-overview"></a>

<a id="chapter-4-airi-card"></a>
### AIRI Character Card

Here you can upload, create, or modify the default character card.

![Airi character card settings window](./assets/manual-airi-card.avif)

::: info About Uploading
The upload dialog suggests any file type is supported, but the editor has not actually used it, and there is no export function either, so details are omitted.
:::

About creating a new character card, the recommended order is:

1. Fill out **Identity**, including name, nickname, description, and creator's notes.
2. Then adjust **Behavior**, including personality, scenario, and greeting.
3. If needed, configure **Modules** for character-specific body modules.
4. Configure the **Artistry** section as needed to set up the image generation function for the character.
5. Finally, review **Settings**, including system prompt, history prompt instructions, and version.
6. When you are ready, click "**Create**" to create the character card.
7. After creation, click the circle in the bottom-right corner of the card, or select the card and click Activate, to enable it.

The most important fields in **Identity** are name and description:

- Name is the official name; if a nickname is set, the nickname will be used first.
- Description is the detailed personality. You can be creative or refer to the default character card.

::: info Editor Notes
- If you refer to the default character card, you may omit the part about ACT tags.
- The editor has not used creator's notes, so details are omitted.
- The editor has not fully tested Behavior, Modules, Artistry, or Settings yet — only the rough purpose is documented above.
:::

::: warning Activation Required
Newly created cards are not enabled by default. You must activate them manually.
:::

<a id="chapter-4-modules"></a>
### Body Modules

Here you can configure various Airi functions, as follows:

![Airi body modules settings window](./assets/manual-modules.avif)

#### Consciousness

Recommended order:

1. Click "**select model**" to open the model picker.
2. In this version, there are two Live2D and two VRM models by default.
3. Select one and click "**confirm**" to switch.

If you want to import your own model, click "**add**" to import a Live2D or VRM model.

::: info Editor Note
Regarding the "Switch to Godot Stage (Experimental)" option—since the manual's editorial team has not yet fully understood this feature and it appears to be in an experimental stage, relevant introduction is omitted for now.
:::

::: warning Before Importing A Model
- Old Live2D models are not supported. You must use files that include "\*.moc3".
- Before importing a Live2D model, compress the model folder into a "\*.zip" file.
:::

#### If you choose a Live2D model

You can continue in this order:

1. Expand "Zoom & Position" to adjust the model's size and position in the main window. x is horizontal (left/right), y is vertical (up/down).
2. Expand "parameters" to set mouse tracking, Idle Animation, frame rate, Auto Blink, Force Auto Blink (fallback timer), Shadow, reset to default parameters, clear model cache, and all model-specific parameters.
